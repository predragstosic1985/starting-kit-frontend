# Starting Kit Frontend Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modern Tech Stack
The application must use TypeScript latest stable version, React 19+ version, and Yarn 4+ for package management. Do not use npm or pnpm. This ensures cutting-edge development with reliable dependency management.

### II. Styling Framework
Primary styling with Material UI for consistent, accessible components. Optional use of SCSS and Tailwind for additional customization and flexibility in design implementation.

### III. Responsive Design
All components and layouts must be fully responsive and mobile-ready. Every feature must work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### IV. Sleek Aesthetics
The design should be modern, sleek, and visually appealing to stand out. Focus on clean interfaces, intuitive user experience, and professional appearance.

### V. Reusability
As a starting kit for POCs, components should be modular, reusable, and easily configurable. Enable rapid prototyping and adaptation for various proof-of-concept projects.

## Technology Constraints

Technology stack requirements include TypeScript latest stable, React 19+, Yarn 4+, and Material UI as primary styling. SCSS and Tailwind are optional for enhanced styling capabilities. All implementations must prioritize performance, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.

## Development Standards

Code must follow TypeScript best practices, React hooks patterns, and Material UI guidelines. Ensure all components include responsive breakpoints and mobile-first design. Conduct regular design reviews to maintain sleek aesthetics. Document reusable components for easy integration in future POCs.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan. Version follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for new features, PATCH for fixes. All PRs must verify compliance with principles. Complexity must be justified.
